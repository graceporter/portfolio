<h2>Biography</h2>
<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Grace Porter and I am a first year student in the
Interactive Design Program at SAIT. My major is in User Experience design.
This is my 4th time changing programs, and I previously earned a diploma
in Environmental Reclamation from Medicine Hat College. I was born and raised
in Medicine Hat, and this is my first year living in Calgary. 
Before coming to SAIT, I worked at a Nature Centre in Police Point Park,
in Medicine Hat. I learned a lot about the local flora and fauna, as well as 
event planning, leading school groups, and organizing programs!</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/51789299">Running</a></li>
  <li>Weight lifting</li>
  <li>Playing soccer</li>
  <li>Hiking</li>
  <li>Camping</li>
  <li>Drawing</li>
  <li>Making coffee</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>I hope to one day be able to work remotely, and live in a van (for at least a year). 
Then, I hope to settle down in a small home outside of the city with my own garden, a few farm animals, a couple cats, and lots of open space.
</p>
