<h2>Biography</h2>
<h3 id="AboutMe:">About Me:</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Grace Porter and I am a first year student in the
Interactive Design Program at SAIT. My major is in User Experience design.
This is my 4th time changing programs, and I previously earned a diploma
in Environmental Reclamation from Medicine Hat College. I was born and raised
in Medicine Hat, and this is my first year living in Calgary. 
Before coming to SAIT, I worked at a Nature Centre in Police Point Park,
in Medicine Hat. I learned a lot about the local flora and fauna, as well as 
event planning, leading school groups, and organizing programs!</p>

<h3 id="Goals">Goals</h3>
<p>I hope to one day be able to work remotely, and live in a van (for at least a year). 
Then, I hope to settle down in a small home outside of the city with my own garden, a few farm animals, a couple cats, and lots of open space.
